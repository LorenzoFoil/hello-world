# hello-world
My first attempt into GitHub
Hello! Hola! Bonjour!

This is my first project for GitHub. I'm excited to learn all new things!

My personal motto for 2020 is "Clarity" and the inspiration is the play on words for perfect vision and the first track off John Mayer's 2003 album, "Heavier Things"
